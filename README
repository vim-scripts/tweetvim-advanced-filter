TweetVim has a simple NG word filter as default filter. This plugin adds a high-configuable filter to TweetVim.

All you have to do is to define a dictionary-function, g:tweetvim_advanced_filter.executor. The function must have one argument and the argument is a dictionary of tweet information. And it must return 1 or 0 which represents if the tweet should be filtered or not.
